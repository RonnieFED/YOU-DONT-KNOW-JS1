    What is JavaScript and how is it different from ECMAScript?
 
JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to build web applications, command line tools and games.
ECMAScript on the other hand is just a specification. ECMA is an organization responsible for definiing standards and take care of the ECMAScript specification.
JavaScript just conforms to these specifications.

    APPLICATION OF JS
 JavaScript is all about behaviour. What should happen when you hover over a button? How should your webpage behave?
  JavaScript is used to implement behavior. It is used in creation of mobile and web applications.
  
    WHY IS SEPERATION OF CONCERN IMPORTANT?
 You don't want your code looking rowdy, untidy or hard to read. Separation of concern is basically separating your HTML code from your Javascript code. Hence, your code is tidy, easy to read and attractive.
    
    VARIABLES
   In Javascript, Variables are used to store data temporarily in a computer's memory.
  We store data at a particular memory location and give it a name.
  
     CONSTANTS
 Constants are fixed variables. They are used when we don't want the value of a variable to change.
 
    PRIMITIVE TYPES
Primitive types are a particular type of values we can assign to a variable. Primitive types include:
a.Strings(String literal)-Text
b.Numbers(Number Literal)
c.Booleans (True or False)
d.Undefned - A variable without a value is undefined.
e.Null - Null is used in situations where we want to clear a variable.

    WHAT DOES DYNAMIC TYPING MEAN?
Dynamic typing in JavaScript refers to the ability of JavaScript to change the type of a variable as the user pleases.

    OBJECTS
Objects are a type of Reference type. An object is like a container that stores similar variables. Objects store variables in curly braces.{}

    ARRAYS
 Arrays are another type of Reference type. An array is used to store a list of objects. Arrays store objects in square brackets.[]
  
    FUNCTIONS
Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. Functions are set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.
